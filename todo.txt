for API resilence and Fault tolerance
1. tenacity -> Automatic Retries and Circuit Breakers for External APIs
2. pybreaker -> Stop calling a failing API temporarily to prevent a cascade of failures
3. Celery with Redis -> You never want your API to hang while sending emails, generating invoices, or confirming payments
4. drf-exceptions-hog or drf-standardized-errors -> Gracefully error handling for DRF
5. django-redis -> Purpose: Reduce DB pressure and use cached data when DB is slow.
6. django-ratelimit -> Prevent abuse (too many requests from same user/IP) which can crash your backend
7. django-health-check -> Adds /health/ endpoint to verify DB, cache, Celery, storage, etc.
8. sentry-sdk -> Log exceptions and performance issues to Sentry (with request context and stack trace)
9. django-db-geventpool -> Adds DB connection pooling for better resilience under load
10. timeouts with requests or httpx -> Without timeouts, one slow API can freeze your entire DRF worker
